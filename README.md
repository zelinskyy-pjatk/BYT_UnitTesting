# Geometrical Shapes - C# with Unit Testing (NUnit)

This project demonstrates the implementation of few geometrical shape classes using C# and object-oriented programming. 
Each shape implements a common interface and provides methods to calculate [surface-area] and [volume] where applicable. 
This project also shows a comprehensive set of unit test using the NUnit framework to verify correctness and handle edge-case scenarios.

Each class implements the shared interface 'IShape' and contain such methods:
```csharp
double CalculateArea();
double CalculateVolume();
```

How to Run the Application
1. Open the solution in Visual Studio or Rider
2. Build the project
3. Run the main program to see console output demonstrating all necessary information (like calculations)
4. Seperately run tests to check correctness
